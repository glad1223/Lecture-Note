Class-Activity Balancing Fashion and Function
In the understanding of balancing fashon and function i have come to understand that there are a  couple of things that are needed to consider.
.Error Messeges
.Syntax Error
.Anthropomorphic Design
.Webpage Design
.Window Design
.Color display
Each of these are important and play a role, so when creating a web page it is very important to consider all of the points above and more to be more functional.
